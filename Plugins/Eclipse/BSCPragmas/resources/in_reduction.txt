<b>in_reduction</b><br>

The in_reduction clause specifies that a task participates in a reduction.


For a given a list item, the in_reduction clause defines a task to be a participant
in a task reduction that is defined by an enclosing region for a matching list item that appears in a
task_reduction clause or a reduction clause with the task modifier, where either:
<br>
<br>
		1. The matching list item has the same storage location as the list item in the in_reduction
clause; or<br>
		2. A private copy, derived from the matching list item, that is used to perform the task reduction
has the same storage location as the list item in the in_reduction clause.
<br>
<br>

For the task construct, the generated task becomes the participating task. For each list item, a
private copy may be created as if the private clause had been used.
For the target construct, the target task becomes the participating task. For each list item, a
private copy will be created in the data environment of the target task as if the private clause had
been used, and this private copy will be implicitly mapped into the device data environment of the
target device.
At the end of the task region, if a private copy was created its value is combined with a copy created
by a reduction scoping clause or with the original list item.
