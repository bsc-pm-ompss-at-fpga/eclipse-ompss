<b>collapse</b><br>

The <b>collapse </b> clause may be used to specify how many loops are associated with the worksharing-loop construct. 
<br>
<br>
The parameter of the collapse clause must be a constant positive  integer expression. If a collapse clause is specified with a parameter value greater than 1, then
 the iterations of the associated loops to which the clause applies are collapsed into one larger
 iteration space that is then divided according to the schedule clause.

 The sequential execution of  the iterations in these associated loops determines the order of the iterations in the collapsed
 iteration space. 
 
 <br><br>
 If no collapse clause is present or its parameter is 1, the only loop that is
 associated with the worksharing-loop construct for the purposes of determining how the iteration
 space is divided according to the schedule clause is the one that immediately follows the
 worksharing-loop directive.
