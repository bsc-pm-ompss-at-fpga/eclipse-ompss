<b>tied</b><br>

The tied clause defines a new task scheduling restriction for the newly created tasks.
Once a thread begins the execution of this task, the task becomes tied to this thread. 
In the case this task has suspended its execution by any task scheduling point only the same thread 
(i.e. the thread to which the task is tied to) may resume its execution.
