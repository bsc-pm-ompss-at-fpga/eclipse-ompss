<b>single</b><br>
The <b>single</b> construct specifies that the associated structured block is executed by only one
of the threads in the team (not necessarily the master thread), in the context of its implicit task.
The other threads in the team, which do not execute the block, wait at an implicit barrier at the end
of the single construct unless a nowait clause is specified.
