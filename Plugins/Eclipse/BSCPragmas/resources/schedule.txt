<b>Determining the Schedule of a Worksharing-Loop</b>
<br>
<br>
When execution encounters a worksharing-loop directive, the schedule clause (if any) on the
directive, and the run-sched-var and def-sched-var ICVs are used to determine how loop iterations
are assigned to threads. 
<br>
<br>If the worksharing-loop directive does not have a schedule clause then the current
value of the def-sched-var ICV determines the schedule. If the worksharing-loop directive has a
schedule clause that specifies the runtime schedule kind then the current value of the
run-sched-var ICV determines the schedule. Otherwise, the value of the schedule clause
determines the schedule.
