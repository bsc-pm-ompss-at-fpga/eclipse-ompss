<b>The Flush Operation</b><br>
The memory model has relaxed-consistency because a thread's temporary view of memory is not
required to be consistent with memory at all times. A value written to a variable can remain in the
thread's temporary view until it is forced to memory at a later time. Likewise, a read from a
variable may retrieve the value from the thread's temporary view, unless it is forced to read from
memory. OpenMP flush operations are used to enforce consistency between a thread's temporary
view of memory and memory, or between multiple threads view of memory.
