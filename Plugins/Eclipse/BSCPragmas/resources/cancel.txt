The cancel construct can alter the previously described flow of execution in an OpenMP region. 
The effect of the cancel construct depends on its construct-type-clause. If a task encounters a 
cancel construct with a taskgroup construct-type-clause, then the task activates cancellation 
and continues execution at the end of its task region, which implies completion of that task. Any 
other task in that taskgroup that has begun executing completes execution unless it encounters a 
cancellation point construct, in which case it continues execution at the end of its task 
region, which implies its completion. Other tasks in that taskgroup region that have not begun 
execution are aborted, which implies their completion.
