<b>Worksharing-Loop Construct</b><br>
The worksharing-loop construct specifies that the iterations of one or more associated loops will be
executed in parallel by threads in the team in the context of their implicit tasks. The iterations are
distributed across threads that already exist in the team that is executing the parallel region to
which the worksharing-loop region binds.
