<b>critical</b>

The critical construct allows programmers to specify regions of code that will be executed in mutual exclusion. <br>
The associated region will be executed by a single thread at a time, other threads will wait at the beginning of  <br>
the critical section until no thread in the team was executing it. <br>
 <br>
The syntax of the critical construct is the following: <br>
 <br>
#pragma omp critical <br>
structured-block <br>
 <br>
The syntax also allows named criticals with the following syntax: <br>
 <br>
#pragma omp critical(<name>) <br>
structured-block <br>
 <br>
Named criticals prevent concurrency between threads with respect to all critical regions with the same name. <br>
Unnammed criticals prevent concurrency between threads with respect to all unnamed critical regions. <br>
 <br>
The critical construct has no related clauses. <br>
