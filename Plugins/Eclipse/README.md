# Eclipse plugin 

This project is divided in three parts.

1. Eclipse Plugin (BSCPragmas)
2. Eclipse Feature Project (OmpSs Autocompletion Features)
3. Eclipse P2 repository (BSCPL)

This is due to the way Eclipse accepts plugins to be installed. For ease of use, these projects must be created using Eclipse.
