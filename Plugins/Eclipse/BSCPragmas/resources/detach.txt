<b>detach</b><br>
If a detach clause is present on a task construct a new event allow-completion-event is created.
The allow-completion-event is connected to the completion of the associated task region. The
original event-handle will be updated to represent the allow-completion-event event before the task
data environment is created. The event-handle will be considered as if it was specified on a
firstprivate clause. The use of a variable in a detach clause expression of a task
construct causes an implicit reference to the variable in all enclosing constructs.
<br><br>
If no detach clause is present on a task construct the generated task is completed when the
execution of its associated structured-block is completed. If a detach clause is present on a task
construct the task is completed when the execution of its associated structured-block is completed
and the allow-completion-event is fulfilled.
