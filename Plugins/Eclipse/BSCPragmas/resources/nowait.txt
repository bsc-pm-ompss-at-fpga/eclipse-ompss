<b>nowait</b><br>

A worksharing region has no <b>barrier </b>on entry; however, an implied <b>barrier </b> exists at the end of the
worksharing region, unless a <b>nowait </b>clause is specified. If a <b>nowait</b> clause is present, an
implementation may omit the <b>barrier </b> at the end of the worksharing region. In this case, threads that
finish early may proceed straight to the instructions that follow the worksharing region without
 waiting for the other members of the team to finish the worksharing region, and without performing
 a flush operation
