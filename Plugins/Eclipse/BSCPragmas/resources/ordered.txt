<b>ordered</b><br>

The <b>ordered</b> construct either specifies a structured block in a worksharing-loop, <b>simd</b>, or
worksharing-loop SIMD region that will be executed in the order of the loop iterations, or it is a
stand-alone directive that specifies cross-iteration dependences in a doacross loop nest. The
<b>ordered</b> construct sequentializes and orders the execution of <b>ordered</b> regions while allowing
code outside the region to run in parallel.
<br>
<br>
The syntax of the <b>ordered</b> construct is as follows:
<br>
<b>#pragma omp ordered </b>[clause[ [,] clause] ] new-line
<br>
    structured-block<br>

where clause is one of the following:
<br>
<br>

threads<br>
simd<br>
or<br>

<b>#pragma omp ordered </b> clause [[[,] clause] ... ] new-line<br>
where clause is one of the following:<br><br>
depend(source)<br>
depend(sink : vec)<br>
