<b>linear</b><br>
The effect of the <b>linear</b> clause is as if it is applied to the innermost constituent construct.
Additionally, if the list item is not the iteration variable of a simd or worksharing-loop SIMD
construct, the effect on the outer constituent constructs is as if the list item was specified in
firstprivate and lastprivate clauses on the combined or composite construct, with the
 rules specified above applied. If a list item of the <b>linear</b> clause is the iteration variable of a
 simd or worksharing-loop SIMD construct and it is not declared in the construct, the effect on the
 outer constituent constructs is as if the list item was specified in a lastprivate clause on the
 combined or composite construct with the rules specified above applied.
