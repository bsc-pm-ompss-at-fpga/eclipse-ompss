# Generate configuration files

If you made any change to the grammatics, you have to copy on **src** folder the tree.json and token.js generated by the AutocompleteGenerator.


# Compile the plugin

In order to compile the plugin, you must have:
* npm
* node
* typescript
* vsce 

installed.

After that, you can create the .vsix (installable package) with the command:

``npm install && vsce package``

This will generate the "OmpSS-completion-1.0.0.vsix" extension, which can be used in Theia and VsCode.
