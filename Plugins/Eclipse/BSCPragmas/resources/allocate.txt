<b> allocate </b>

The allocate clause specifies the memory allocator to be used to obtain storage for private variables of a directive.

<br><b>Syntax</b>
The syntax of the allocate clause is as follows:
<br>allocate([allocator:] list)<br>
where allocator is an expression of the omp_allocator_handle_t type.
<br>


<b>Description</b>
The storage for new list items that arise from list items that appear in the directive will be provided <br>
through a memory allocator. If an allocator is specified in the clause, that allocator will be used for <br>
allocations. For all directives except the target directive, if no allocator is specified in the clause <br>
then the memory allocator that is specified by the def-allocator-var ICV will be used for the list <br>
items that are specified in the allocate clause. The allocation of each list item will be byte <br>
aligned to at least the alignment required by the base language for the type of that list item. <br>
For allocations that arise from this clause the null_fb value of the fallback allocator trait will <br>
behave as if the abort_fb had been specified. <br>
